## Good Bye 2024, Hello 2025!
This is my 2024 end-of-year personal project, created during my vacation in Korea! üá∞üá∑
After noticing many new grads and fellow engineers struggle with LeetCode practice, I built this tool, drawing on my experience as an interviewer.
This project is designed to help you quickly master the standardized interview format, making it easier to approach and navigate through challenging questions.

If you have any questions, feel free to start a thread in [Discussions](https://github.com/yordlejason/boring.interview/discussions).
I hope you enjoy using this tool! üôè 

## Introduction
boring.interview is designed to assist candidates in mastering LeetCode-style technical interview questions. Whether you're a beginner venturing into coding challenges or a seasoned developer aiming to refine your problem-solving skills, boring.interview provides a structured and supportive environment to boost your preparation. 

## Demo
[![boring.interview Demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b585ac34-30da-4d3c-bfee-cdc3d3b12d97)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHIIebi3fws "boring.interview Demo")

## How It Works:
1.	Screen Sharing: Share your screen to capture coding challenges or problems displayed in any application.
2.	OCR & Text Extraction: The app processes the captured screen to extract relevant text.
3.	Solve: Once the text is parsed, boring.interview sends the query to an AI backend for analysis and solution generation.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS recommended, works perfectly well with [v22.7.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.7.0))
- **npm** or **yarn** for package management
- **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain at [OpenAI's Website](https://platform.openai.com/)

## Installation

1.	Clone this repository:

```https://github.com/yordlejason/boring.interview.git```

2.	Install Server Dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

3.	Add environment variables to `.env` file (in `server/`)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
PORT=3000
```
If you chose to use single API only, you don't have to fill out the other API Key.

4.	Install Frontend Dependencies:
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

## Running the Application
1.	Start the server:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```
The server runs at http://localhost:3000.

2.	Start the client:
```bash
cd ../client
npm run dev
```
The client runs at http://localhost:5173.

## Usage
1.	Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser (Chrome works the best).
3.	Click ‚ÄúStart Screen Capture‚Äù. Your browser will prompt you to select a screen or window to share.
4.	The application will silently capture the screen, run OCR, and solve the question.
5.	Final answer will be displayed on the page.

## Tech Stack
-	Client: React, Vite, TypeScript
-	OCR: Tesseract.js (no external OCR API needed)
-	ChatGPT & DeepSeek Integration: OpenAI Node.js SDK
-	Markdown Rendering: react-markdown + remark-gfm

## Troubleshooting
- `Configuration is not a constructor error`: Ensure you have the latest OpenAI Node.js SDK and a compatible Node.js version.
- Permission issues capturing the screen: Verify that the browser supports `getDisplayMedia()` and that you have allowed screen capture.
- No questions detected: Ensure the on-screen text is clearly visible and recognizable by OCR.
